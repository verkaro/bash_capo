Now the first of December was covered with snow
and so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
Oh the birkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frostin
with 10 miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when you take to the highway
A song that they sing when you take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
but singing does just fine for me
(chorus)
